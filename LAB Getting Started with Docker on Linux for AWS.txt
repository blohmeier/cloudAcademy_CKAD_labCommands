Logging in to the Amazon Web Services Console
Introduction
This lab experience involves Amazon Web Services (AWS), and you will use the AWS Management Console to complete all the lab steps.

alt

The AWS Management Console is a web control panel for managing all your AWS resources, from EC2 instances to SNS topics. The console enables cloud management for all aspects of the AWS account, including managing security credentials and even setting up new IAM Users.

 

Instructions
1. To start the lab experience, open the Amazon Console by clicking the Open Environment button in the upper-left corner of the lab:

alt

You will see 100% Setup completed status once the lab environment resources are created.

 

2. Enter the following credentials created just for your lab session, and click Sign in:

Account ID or alias: 819145381160
IAM user name: student
Password: Ca1_HpGrh78C

3. Select the US West (Oregon) us-west-2 region using the upper-right drop-down menu on the AWS Management Console:

alt

Amazon Web Services is available in different regions all over the world, and the console lets you provision resources across multiple regions. You usually choose a region that best suits your business needs to optimize your customerâ€™s experience, but you must use the US West 2 for this Lab.

 

Recommendation: For an optimal lab experience, ensure that you are using a supported browser when accessing the AWS Management Console. For example, an up-to-date version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

Connecting to the Virtual Machine using EC2 Instance Connect
Introduction
In next lab step you will use a shell on a Linux host to install Docker.

In this lab step, you will connect to an EC2 instance using EC2 Instance Connect and access a shell.

 

Instructions
1. In the AWS Management Console search bar, enter EC2, and click the EC2 result under Services:

alt

 

2. To see available instances, click Instances in the left-hand menu:

alt

The instances list page will open, and you will see an instance named cloudacademylabs:

alt

If you don't see a running instance then the lab environment is still loading. Wait until the Instance state is Running.

 

3. Right-click the cloudacademylabs instance, and click Connect:

alt

The Connect to your instance form will load.

 

4. In the form, ensure the EC2 Instance Connect tab is selected:

alt

You will see the instance's Instance ID and Public IP address displayed.

 

5. In the User name textbox, enter ec2-user:

alt

 

6. To open a browser-based shell, click Connect:

alt

If you see an error it's likely that the environment hasn't finished setting up. Check for Setup completed at the top-left corner of the lab and try connecting again:

alt

A browser-based shell will open in a new window ready for you to use.

Keep this window open, you will use it in later lab steps.

You can also connect to the instance using your preferred SSH client and the PPK (Windows) or PEM (Mac/Linux) key files in the Credentials section of this lab.

Installing Docker on Amazon Linux

Introduction
You will install Docker using the yum package manager that is available on Amazon Linux. Docker comes in two flavors: Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). The community edition is open source and available free of charge. It includes the core Docker functionality and was previously called "Docker Engine." The enterprise edition requires a subscription and includes a support package, a certification program to create trusted containers and extensions, and other features. You will be installing the community edition. You will also see how to add your user to the docker group to use the Docker commands without elevating to root permissions.

 

Instructions
 1. Enter the following to install Docker:

Copy code
1
sudo yum -y install docker
 

2. Enter the command below to start Docker as a service:

Copy code
1
sudo systemctl start docker
 

3. Verify Docker is running by entering:

Copy code
1
sudo docker info
This will output system-wide information about Docker. The information will resemble the following:

alt

You can see some useful information, such as the number of containers, and the version of the Docker server. Docker adopts a client-server architecture, so the server doesn't have to be running on the same host as the client. In your case, you are using the Docker command line interface (CLI) client to connect to the server, called the Docker daemon.

 

Summary 
In this Lab Step, you added the official Docker CE repositories to the yum package manager and installed Docker CE. You also learned your first Docker command to print system-wide information relevant to Docker.
